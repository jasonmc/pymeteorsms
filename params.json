{"name":"Pymeteorsms","tagline":"Python program to send text messages via meteor website. Aims to be similar to classic meteorsms Perl script.","body":"## PyMeteorSMS\r\nUnfortunately meteor changed their web interface recently, which broke the classic meteorsms Perl script. Initially I looked at fixing that script, but it uses TestGen4Web which is practically dead now. I decided to reverse engineer the site myself. They now use ajax requests for lots of things, which would've made TestGen4Web useless anyhow. It does provide us with essentially an API however. I first used mechanize, but due to some bug with https and proxies, I couldn't use it from one of my computers, so I created a version using just urllib2. This has the added bonus of making substantially less requests and therefore is faster.\r\n\r\nThis code supports the original meteorsms config script syntax.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nPython 2.6 onwards include required libraries.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nJust run the script :)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/meteorsms.py mark\r\n[ recipient : mark (+35387xxxxxxx) ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nGPLv3\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nJason McCandless (jasonmccandless@gmail.com) @jasonmc\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nJason McCandless (jasonmccandless@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nYou can download this project in either\r\n[zip](http://github.com/jasonmc/pymeteorsms/zipball/master) or\r\n[tar](http://github.com/jasonmc/pymeteorsms/tarball/master) formats.\r\n\r\nYou can also clone the project with [Git](http://git-scm.com)\r\n      by running:\r\n      <pre>$ git clone git://github.com/jasonmc/pymeteorsms</pre>\r\n    ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
